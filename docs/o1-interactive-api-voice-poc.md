Below is a basic Proof-of-Concept (PoC) that demonstrates how to set up a FastAPI application with a WebSocket endpoint that can receive audio data and respond back with simple acknowledgments. This will help you gain familiarity with WebSockets in a Python/FastAPI context before integrating more complex speech-to-text logic.

**Key Points of the PoC**:  
- Users connect to a WebSocket endpoint (`/ws`) from a client.  
- Clients send audio data (binary) in small chunks.  
- The server responds with a textual acknowledgment after receiving each chunk.  
- The PoC focuses on the mechanics of WebSockets and binary data handling, not on actual transcription.

**Steps to Run**:  
1. Save the code below in a file named `main.py`.  
2. Run: `uvicorn main:app --reload`  
3. Connect a WebSocket client (e.g., using a browser client, `websocat`, or a small Python script) to `ws://localhost:8000/ws`.  
4. Send small binary messages (dummy audio frames) and observe the server’s responses.

### Example Code

```python
from typing import Optional
import asyncio
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app = FastAPI(
    title="Voice Interaction POC",
    description="A basic PoC for real-time voice interaction using WebSockets and FastAPI.",
    version="0.1.0"
)

# Allow CORS for local testing (adjust in production)
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"]
)


@app.get("/", response_class=HTMLResponse)
def get_home_page() -> str:
    """
    Return a simple HTML page with instructions on how to connect to the WebSocket endpoint.
    
    :return: HTML content as a string.
    """
    return """

    The actual WebSocket connection upgrade occurs on the /ws websocket route below.

            await websocket.send_text(response_msg)
    except WebSocketDisconnect:

        print("Client disconnected.")

        await websocket.send_text(error_msg)
        await websocket.close(code=1011, reason="Internal server error")
```

### How to Test with a Simple Client (Python)

```python
import asyncio
import websockets

async def test_client():
    uri = "ws://localhost:8000/ws"
    async with websockets.connect(uri) as websocket:
        # Receive the initial welcome message
        welcome = await websocket.recv()
        print("Server:", welcome)
        
        # Send a dummy binary message representing audio data
        await websocket.send(b"\x00\x01\x02\x03\x04")
        ack = await websocket.recv()
        print("Server:", ack)

        # Send more binary data
        await websocket.send(b"\x10\x20\x30")
        ack = await websocket.recv()
        print("Server:", ack)

        # Close the connection
        await websocket.close()

asyncio.run(test_client())
```

### Next Steps

1. **Adding Speech-to-Text**:  
   Once comfortable with WebSockets, integrate a speech-to-text engine (e.g., a third-party API or a local ASR library) inside the `while True` loop. Convert incoming audio frames into text and send back partial transcripts instead of static acknowledgments.

2. **Error Handling & Authentication**:  
   Add authentication tokens, error codes, and more sophisticated error handling. Make sure to document the changes in your OpenAPI spec and provide clear instructions to your clients.

3. **Scalability & Performance**:  
   For a production environment, consider scaling out, adding load balancing, and implementing streaming STT services that can handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently.
   
By implementing this simple PoC, you’ll gain confidence with WebSockets in FastAPI and be better prepared to integrate real-time voice processing.
